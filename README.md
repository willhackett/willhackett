### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in London, United Kingdom. I'm currently part of the team at [Pactio](https://pactio.io) making better deal structuring software for private equity advisors.

Previously, I've contributed to teams at [Blinq](https://blinq.me), [SEEK](https://seek.com.au), [Linktree](https://linktr.ee) and more.

In my spare time I work on [HeyJamie](https://heyjamie.ai) a project aimed at bringing personal context to AI through your inbox & calendar.
